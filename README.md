# JavaScript_basics

This directory contains the examples of the tasks that I performed during my studies of **JavaScript fundamentals**.

# JavaScript_Arrays

This directory contains some of the tasks on **JavaScript array methods** that I've completed on https://www.codewars.com/

I like training on this platform because this is a great way to put the theoretical knowledge of JS into practice.

At the moment, I'm mostly solving the kata of the 8 kyu rank but as soon as I finish learning certain topics, I'm going to proceed to the next rank tasks.

I've already completed more than 150 kata in JS.
