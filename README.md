# JavaScript_basics

This directory contains the examples of the tasks that I performed during my studies of **JavaScript fundamentals**.

# JavaScript_arrays

This directory contains some of the tasks on **JavaScript array methods** that I've completed on https://www.codewars.com/

I like training on this platform because this is a great way to put the theoretical knowledge of JS into practice.

I've already completed more than 200 kata of the 7 and 8 kyu rank.
